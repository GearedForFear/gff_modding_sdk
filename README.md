# GFF Modding SDK
This is the official modding SDK of Geared for Fear. The repository is [open source](/LICENSE), including the contents of the base game, that are in this repository. Feel free to use them for your own game. This includes all Scripts of the base game. The full source files of the game's ongoing alpha is free to download (but not under any license) on [itch.io](//gearedforfear.itch.io/geared-for-fear-alpha).<br>

Keep in mind, that the game is currently in alpha, so mods have a high likelyhood of not working in future versions. The repository's main branch may be ahead of the latest release on itch.io. The documentation is largely incomplete. Even when finished, it is meant to be used in combination with [the Engine documentation.](//docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/) Most importantly, other people's mods may contain malicious code. When starting the modified game, that code will run.<br>

Modding Geared for Fear requires [Godot 3](//godotengine.org/download), which is [free and open source.](//godotengine.org/license)
